# Natural Selection 2 'Classic Entities Mod'

Adds some additional entities inspired by Half-Life 1 and the
Extra Entities Mod by JimWest - https://github.com/JimWest/ExtraEntitesMod
Designed to work with maps developed for Extra Entities Mod.

Included editor_setup.xml file includes all entities needed for building maps.
There are some entities included in this mod which are only used to convert from EEM Maps.
These should not be placed in newly designed maps as they are redundant.

Included in the Editor Setup are the entities for Water Mod.
If those entities are used, you will also need to run Water Mod.
